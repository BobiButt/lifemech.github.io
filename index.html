    In this mordern age almost all work needs computer. Computer is now widely
    use in schools, offices, homes, banks and many more places.They all need a
    mordern computer for their proper work.Even in homes, most of the children
    or elders need a better computer for their task. But unfortunately they have
    an old PC or laptop that can only run Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows
    7. Most of the programs and games need a specific Operating System with a
    better Processor speed and RAM. By lacking of processing speed and RAM, they
    cannot runs programs and games as they desired.

      In old PCs, the processor speed is very low. They runs only Windows XP or
      Windows Vista. Most of the memory is consumed by the Operating System
      that is currently use. Therefore user cannot run programs properly. Computer
      become laggy. For these, there are some Operating Systems that can suit to
      your PC or laptop. Here, in my website, you can find almost all Operating
      Systems for any old PC or Laptop with 4GB RAM, 2GB RAM, 1GB RAM and even
      512MB RAM. As Microsoft has stopped the support of window XP, Windows
      Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8, so there is no upcomming updates of
      Windows . Its mean your data is no longer safe in these OS.

      Windows 8 is also an unsupported OS, but its antivirus is still works.
      Moreover it has Microsoft Store, so you can download some apps as well as
      games for your PC without any interruption.
